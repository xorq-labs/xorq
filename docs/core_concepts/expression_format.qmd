title: Expression Format
---

Xorq uses a YAML-based serialization format for storing expression artifacts. This human-readable format enables:

- **Version Control:** Store expression definitions alongside your code with meaningful diffs
- **Lineage Tracking:** Complete schemas and dependency information preserved in YAML
- **Debugging:** Debug outputs for SQL and metadata included in artifacts
- **Roundtrip Compatibility:** Expressions can roundtrip back and forth from Ibis expressions

When you build an expression, Xorq generates several YAML files:

- expr.yaml - Complete expression definition with schemas and lineage
- deferred_reads.yaml - Information about deferred data reads
- profiles.yaml - Backend profile configurations
- sql.yaml - Generated SQL for debugging

**Note:** A comprehensive JSON specification for the Expression Format is coming soon.
