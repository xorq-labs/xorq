title: 'Multi-Engine'
---

Move data between different engines within a single expression using `into_backend()`.

```{python}
import xorq.api as xo

# Connect to engines
pg = xo.postgres.connect_env()
db = xo.duckdb.connect()

# Load data from different sources
batting = pg.table("batting")
awards = xo.examples.awards_players.fetch(backend=db)

# Filter in respective engines
recent = batting.filter(batting.yearID == 2015)
nl_awards = awards.filter(awards.lgID == "NL")

# Move data to postgres for join
result = recent.join(
    nl_awards.into_backend(pg),
    ["playerID"]
)

result.execute()
```

### Key Features

* **Zero-copy transfers** using Apache Arrow
* **Automatic optimization** of data placement
* **Transparent movement** between any supported engines

### When to Use

* **Leverage engine strengths** - Use DuckDB for local analysis, Postgres for joins
* **Combine data sources** - Join tables from different databases
* **Optimize performance** - Move small tables to where large tables live
