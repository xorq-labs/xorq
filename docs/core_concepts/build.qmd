The xorq CLI provides two powerful commands, `build` and `run`, that help you separate the definition of data transformations from their execution. This separation enables:

- **Replicability**: Define transformations once and execute them consistently
  across different environments with guaranteed identical results.
- **Serialization:** Store complex queries as compiled artifacts that can be
  shared, versioned, and executed without the original code
- **Performance optimization:** Pre-compile expressions to avoid repeated
  parsing and optimization at runtime

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have xorq installed:

```bash
pip install xorq
```

## Building Expressions

The `build` command compiles an Ibis expression into a reusable artifact that
can be executed later.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for the `build` command is:

```bash
xorq build <script_path> -e <expression_name> --builds-dir <output_directory>
```

Where:
- `<script_path>` is the path to your Python script containing the expression
- `<expression_name>` is the name of the variable holding the Ibis expression
- `<builds-dir>` is where the artifacts will be generated (defaults to "builds")

### Example

Let's create a simple script that defines an Ibis expression:

```{python}
#| eval: false

import xorq as xo
from xorq.common.utils.defer_utils import deferred_read_parquet
from xorq.expr.relations import into_backend


pg = xo.postgres.connect_env()
db = xo.duckdb.connect()

batting = pg.table("batting")

integer = 1

backend = xo.duckdb.connect()
awards_players = deferred_read_parquet(
    backend,
    xo.config.options.pins.get_path("awards_players"),
    table_name="award_players",
)
left = batting.filter(batting.yearID == 2015)
right = awards_players.filter(awards_players.lgID == "NL").drop("yearID", "lgID")
expr = left.join(
    into_backend(right, pg, "pg-filtered-table"), ["playerID"], how="semi"
)[["yearID", "stint"]]
```

Now, let's build this expression using the CLI:

```bash
xorq build pipeline.py -e expr --builds-dir artifacts
```

This command will:
1. Load the `pipeline.py` script
2. Find the `expr` variable
3. Generate artifacts based on the expression
4. Save them to the `artifacts` directory

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Building expr from pipeline.py
Written 'expr' to artifacts/3350466c8fcd
```

## Running Expressions

Once you've built an expression, you can execute it with the `run` command.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for the `run` command is:

```bash
xorq run <build_path> --output-path <output_file> --format <output_format>
```

Where:
- `<build_path>` is the path to the built expression
- `--output-path` argument specifies where to write the results (defaults to discarding output, writing to [os.devnull](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.devnull))
- `--format` argument specifies the output format, which can be "csv", "json", or "parquet" (defaults to "parquet")

### Example

To run the expression we built earlier and save the results to a parquet file:

```bash
xorq run artifacts/2a3b46d8d3d0 --output-path results.parquet
```

To save the results as CSV instead:

```bash
xorq run artifacts/2a3b46d8d3d0 --output-path results.csv --format csv
```

## Error Handling

The CLI will provide helpful error messages if:

- The script doesn't exist
- The expression variable isn't found in the script
- The variable isn't an Ibis expression
- No expression name is provided for the build command
- The build path doesn't exist or isn't a valid xorq artifact
- The output format isn't supported
