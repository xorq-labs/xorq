### Backend Selection Guidelines

Choose engines based on their strengths:

1. **DuckDB**: Local processing, AsOf joins, efficient file formats
2. **DataFusion**: Custom UDFs, streaming processing
3. **Trino**: Distributed queries, federation, security
4. **Snowflake/BigQuery**: Managed infrastructure, scalability

### Data Transfer

Data movement between engines is handled through:

1. **Arrow Flight**: Zero-copy data transfer protocol
2. **Memory Management**: Automatic spilling to disk
3. **Batching**: Efficient chunk-based processing
