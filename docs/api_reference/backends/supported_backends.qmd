description: "Engines you can use and when to choose each"

Backends are registered in the package and loaded on first use (e.g. `xo.duckdb`, `xo.postgres`). The default backend for `xo.connect()` is the embedded Xorq engine (DataFusion-based).

## In-process engines

Engines that run in your process; no separate server.

- **xorq**: Default embedded engine (`xo.connect()`).
- DuckDB
- DataFusion
- Pandas
- SQLite

## Distributed engines

Engines that run on remote or managed infrastructure.

- Trino
- Snowflake
- BigQuery (via Ibis)

## Table formats

Engines for table formats and catalogs.

- **PyIceberg**: Apache Iceberg tables; use `xo.pyiceberg.connect_env()` or connect with a catalog URI.

## When to use which

Use this table to pick an engine for your workload.

| Engine | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| xorq (default) | Embedded execution, no external server |
| DuckDB | Local processing, AsOf joins, efficient file formats |
| DataFusion | Custom UDFs, streaming |
| Pandas | In-memory, small data, prototyping |
| SQLite | Local file-based SQL, portability |
| Trino | Distributed queries, federation, security |
| Snowflake / BigQuery | Managed infrastructure, scale |
| PyIceberg | Iceberg tables, time travel, catalog backends (SQL, Hive, Glue) |

## Data movement

Data moves between engines via Arrow Flight (zero-copy), with automatic spilling to disk and chunk-based batching when needed.
