Compare two builds using `git diff --no-index`. Use this to see what changed between two build directories (e.g. after changing an expression or dependencies).

## Usage

Pass two build targets to compare them with `git diff --no-index`.

```bash
xorq catalog diff-builds <left> <right> [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

The two builds to compare.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `left` | Left build: alias, entry ID, build ID, or path to build dir |
| `right` | Right build: alias, entry ID, build ID, or path to build dir |

## Options

Which files to diff.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--all` | | Diff all known build files plus all `.sql` files |
| `--files` | | Explicit list of relative file paths to diff (overrides `--all`) |

## Examples

Compare two build directories or aliases.

```bash
xorq catalog diff-builds builds/abc123 builds/def456
xorq catalog diff-builds alias-v1 alias-v2 --all
```
