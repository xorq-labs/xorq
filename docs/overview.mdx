xorq is a portable, Python-based data processing toolchain designed to simplify
building and executing deferred, fit-transform pipelines common in ML
workflows.

xorq supports multiple engines, enabling efficient and seamless data transfers
between them. It enhances reproducibility across the ML lifecycle through
diffable YAML and SQL artifacts, along with an intuitive CLI. xorq’s composable
architecture makes it easy to construct disaggregated pipelines, allowing you
to right-size each component—such as preprocessing—according to your needs.

Whether you’re a data scientist or an ML engineer, xorq empowers you to create
robust, reproducible pipelines without sacrificing performance or ease of use.

```python
expr
.filter([_.karma > 10.0,...])
.pipe(hn_flight_udxf)
.mutate(transformed=tfidf.on_expr)
.mutate(predicted=xgb_predict.on_expr)
.execute()
```

> **Mission Statement:**  
> “Make data processing ergonomic, performant and reproducible.”


### Features

- **DataFrame API (Ibis-Powered):** Define transformations using a familiar, pandas-like 
  API that is both expressive and backend-agnostic.
- **Cache:** Avoid redundant computations by materializing intermediate results
  as Arrow RecordBatches, ensuring minimal re-computation.
- **Python UDFs:** Write and serve Python UDFs seamlessly – whether they’re
  used for aggregation, windowing, or transformation tasks. Support native UDFs
  or Flight-based exchanger functions (UDxF)
- **Multi-Engine:** Effortlessly switch or combine execution engines—DuckDB,
  DataFusion, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake—optimizing performance and
  scalability. 
- **Arrow-Native:**Built around Apache Arrow and Arrow Flight, xorq leverages columnar data
  structures to maximize performance, minimize memory usage, and accelerate
  data transfers. 

  **Supported Engines:**
- Local Engines:
  - DuckDB
  - DataFusion
  - xorq Custom Engine (optimized for Python UDFs)
- Remote Engines:
  - Postgres
  - BigQuery
  - Snowflake
