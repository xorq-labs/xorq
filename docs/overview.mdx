Have you ever inherited a machine learning pipeline from a Jupyter notebook
that needed extensive revisions just to operationalize? We have too. After
years of struggling with pipelines that worked perfectly in notebooks but
consistently failed in production, we built xorq to solve exactly these pains.

xorq eliminates the headaches of porting local pandas logic to SQL backends,
debugging runtime mismatches, wasteful recomputation and lack of out-of-core
operations, leading to unreliable deployments. Built on powerful foundations
like Ibis and DataFusion, xorq introduces deferred expressions, portable UDFs,
and efficient caching—making pipeline development as intuitive as writing
pandas or scikit-learn code, but seamlessly bridging the gap between data
science and data engineering.

Get started now:
```shell
pip install xorq
```

```python
expr = (
  pg.table("batting")
    .into_backend(con, "xo_batting")
    .limit(15)
    .select(player_id="playerID", year_id="yearID_right")
    .cache(SourceStorage(source=con))
)
```

```sh
xorq build examples/into_backend_example.py --target-dir=builds --expressions expr
```
You can view diffable artifacts that can roundtrip back to the original expression:

```
❯ ls -ah builds/7a36621710a7
1f32d6616575.sql
deferred_reads.yaml
expr.yaml
metadata.json
profiles.yaml
sql.yaml
```


xorq is a portable, Python-based data processing toolchain designed to simplify
building and executing deferred, fit-transform pipelines common in ML
workflows.

Whether you’re a data scientist or an ML engineer, xorq empowers you to create
robust, reproducible pipelines without sacrificing performance or ease of use.

> **Mission Statement:**  
> “Make data processing ergonomic, performant and reproducible.”


### Features

- **DataFrame API (Ibis-Powered):** Define transformations using a familiar, pandas-like 
  API that is both expressive and backend-agnostic.
- **Cache:** Avoid redundant computations by materializing intermediate results
  as Arrow RecordBatches, ensuring minimal re-computation.
- **Python UDFs:** Write and serve Python UDFs seamlessly – whether they’re
  used for aggregation, windowing, or transformation tasks. Support native UDFs
  or Flight-based exchanger functions (UDxF)
- **Multi-Engine:** Effortlessly switch or combine execution engines—DuckDB,
  DataFusion, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake—optimizing performance and
  scalability. 
- **Arrow-Native:** Built around Apache Arrow and Arrow Flight, xorq leverages columnar data
  structures to maximize performance, minimize memory usage, and accelerate
  data transfers. 

**Supported Engines:**

- Local Engines:
  - DuckDB
  - DataFusion
  - xorq Custom Engine (optimized for Python UDFs)
- Remote Engines:
  - Postgres
  - BigQuery
  - Snowflake

### Benefits

- Avoiding wasteful recomputations
- Take your UDFs to the data via Flight end-points
- DAG of single-engine expressions, not tasks
- Research to production 
- Easily extract servable artifacts from pipeline e.g. models
- Composable and disaggregated pipelines
