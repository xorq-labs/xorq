Tired of spending 60% of your time rewriting ML notebook code for production?
xorq bridges your data science experiments and production pipelines with a
single, unified framework. Built on Ibis's deferred expression system, xorq
lets you write pandas-style code once that seamlessly runs across local,
remote, or hybrid environments without modification.

xorq enables data professionals to:
- Write once, run anywhere: Author familiar pandas-style code that processes
  data as a RecordBatch stream, getting rid of out-of-memory errors even with
  massive datasets
- Version control your pipelines: Automatically serialize expressions to clean,
  diffable YAML artifacts that integrate seamlessly with CI/CD workflows
- Leverage the best of both worlds: Connect to enterprise data sources
  (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake) while augmenting with powerful in-process
  engines (DuckDB, DataFusion) for Python UDFs and specialized operations
- Develop at lightning speed: Intelligently cache intermediate results to
  eliminate redundant computations, cutting iteration time from hours to
  minutes

Get started now:

```shell
pip install xorq
```
and write your first expression:

```python
expr = (
  pg.table("batting")
    .into_backend(con, "xo_batting")
    .limit(15)
    .select(player_id="playerID", year_id="yearID_right")
    .cache(SourceStorage(source=con))
)
```

Assuming you saved your pipeline as pipeline.py, you can run the following CLI
command to build and inspect the compiled artifacts:

```sh
xorq build examples/into_backend_example.py --expressions expr
```

Whether you’re a data scientist or an ML engineer, xorq empowers you to create
robust, reproducible pipelines without sacrificing performance or ease of use.

> **Mission Statement:**  
> “Make data processing ergonomic, performant and reproducible.”


### Features

- **DataFrame API (Ibis-Powered):** Define transformations using a familiar, pandas-like 
  API that is both expressive and backend-agnostic.
- **Cache:** Avoid redundant computations by materializing intermediate results
  as Arrow RecordBatches, ensuring minimal re-computation.
- **Python UDFs:** Write and serve Python UDFs seamlessly – whether they’re
  used for aggregation, windowing, or transformation tasks. Support native UDFs
  or Flight-based exchanger functions (UDxF)
- **Multi-Engine:** Effortlessly switch or combine execution engines—DuckDB,
  DataFusion, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake—optimizing performance and
  scalability. 
- **Arrow-Native:** Built around Apache Arrow and Arrow Flight, xorq leverages columnar data
  structures to maximize performance, minimize memory usage, and accelerate
  data transfers. 

**Supported Engines:**

- Local Engines:
  - DuckDB
  - DataFusion
  - xorq Custom Engine (optimized for Python UDFs)
- Remote Engines:
  - Postgres
  - BigQuery
  - Snowflake

### Benefits

- Avoiding wasteful recomputations
- Take your UDFs to the data via Flight end-points
- DAG of single-engine expressions, not tasks
- Seamless research-to-production
- Easily extract servable artifacts from pipeline e.g. models
- Enable composable and disaggregated pipelines
