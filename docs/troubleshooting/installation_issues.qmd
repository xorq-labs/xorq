This page covers pip and environment problems when installing Xorq or backends. By the end, you will know how to fix "No matching distribution found," import errors, and missing backends.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No matching distribution found

**Error**: Pip reports no matching distribution for Xorq (or similar).

**Cause**: Your Python version is below 3.10. Xorq requires Python 3.10 or higher.

**Solution**: Check your version and upgrade if needed:

```bash
python --version
```

Output should show 3.10 or higher. To upgrade, use the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Issue: ModuleNotFoundError when importing Xorq

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xorq'` (or similar).

**Cause**: Xorq is not installed in the Python environment you are using.

**Solution**: Activate the correct virtual environment, then install Xorq:

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install xorq
```

**Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install xorq
```

### Issue: Backend connection fails after install

**Cause**: Connection failures are usually due to missing credentials or wrong configuration.

**Solution**: See [Backend connection issues](backend_connection_issues.qmd) for environment variables (PostgreSQL), credentials (Snowflake and Trino), and network checks.

### Issue: No module named 'duckdb' or another backend

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'duckdb'` (or the backend you use).

**Cause**: The backend you are using is not installed.

**Solution**: Install the backend you need:

```bash
pip install "xorq[duckdb]"
```

To install all backends:

```bash
pip install "xorq[examples,duckdb,snowflake,postgres,pyiceberg,datafusion,sqlite]"
```

### Issue: Query execution is slow or hangs

**Cause**: Often due to large data or a backend that does not fit the workload.

**Solution**: See [Performance problems](performance_problems.qmd) for when to use DuckDB, Pandas, or Snowflake and BigQuery.
