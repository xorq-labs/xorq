After completing this guide, you have a working ML pipeline. This pipeline loads data, trains a model, and generates predictions. It uses Xorq's deferred execution model.

## What you'll build

In this quickstart, you:

1. Set up your environment and install Xorq
2. Initialize a project
3. Build a pipeline expression
4. Run your pipeline and save results
5. Serve your pipeline as an endpoint

The entire process takes about five minutes. By the end, you understand how Xorq transforms Python code into executable, servable pipelines.

## Step 1: Set up your environment and install Xorq

This step covers environment setup, Xorq installation, and verification.

### Check your Python version

::: {.callout-tip}
### Python version
Xorq requires Python 3.9 or higher. Check your version with `python --version`. If you need to install or update Python, then visit the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
:::

### Create a virtual environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS/Linux
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

:::

### Update pip

Before installing Xorq, update pip to the latest version. This avoids compatibility issues:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install Xorq

Now install Xorq using your preferred package manager:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### pip (macOS/Linux)
```bash
pip install "xorq[examples]"
```

### pip (Windows)
```bash
pip install xorq[examples]
```

### nix
```bash
nix run github:xorq-labs/xorq
```

:::

### Verify installation

Verify your installation by checking the version. Open a Python shell:
```bash
python
```

::: {.callout-note}
If `python` does not work, then try `python3` instead.
:::

Import Xorq and check the version:
```python
import xorq
xorq.__version__
```

You see a version number like `'0.3.3'`.

Exit the Python shell:
```python
exit()
```

If you see a version number, then Xorq is installed correctly.

With Xorq installed, the next step is to create your first project.

## Step 2: Initialize a project

Create a new Xorq project using the built-in penguins template. This template demonstrates a complete ML workflow with the Palmer Penguins dataset:
```bash
xorq init -t penguins -p penguins_example # <1>
cd penguins_example # <2>
```
1. Creates a new project called penguins_example using the penguins template.
2. Moves into the project directory.

The template generates an `expr.py` file. This file contains a complete ML pipeline with data loading, train/test splitting, model training, and prediction.

::: {.callout-note}
The penguins template includes caching, lineage tracking, and a scikit-learn logistic regression model. You can explore our [ten-minute tour](/tutorials/getting_started/10-minute-tour) to understand the generated pipeline after completing this quickstart.
:::

With your project initialized, the next step is to build it into an executable format.

## Step 3: Build your expression

Convert your pipeline into a serialized, executable format using the `build` command:
```bash
xorq build expr.py
```

**Output:**
```
Building expr from expr.py
Written 'expr' to builds/12287e173c17
builds/12287e173c17
```

The build creates a directory (like `builds/12287e173c17`) containing your serialized pipeline. This hash uniquely identifies your build.

![](../../images/quickstart/build-output-hash.png)

With your pipeline built, the next step is to run it and see results.

## Step 4: Run your pipeline

Execute your built pipeline and view the results. Replace `<BUILD_HASH>` with the hash from your build output in step 3:

::: {.callout-warning}
### Windows users
Skip the first tab and go straight to "Save to file". Running without an output file may cause issues on Windows.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### View results
```bash
xorq run builds/<BUILD_HASH>
```

### Save to file
```bash
xorq run builds/<BUILD_HASH> -o predictions.parquet
```

### Limit output
```bash
xorq run builds/<BUILD_HASH> --limit 10 -o predictions.parquet
```

:::

The command saves prediction results to `predictions.parquet`. You can open this file with any Parquet-compatible tool. Compatible tools include pandas, DuckDB, or Polars.

With your pipeline running locally, the next step is to serve it as an endpoint.

## Step 5: Serve your pipeline

Serve your pipeline as an API endpoint using Arrow Flight. This allows other applications to query your pipeline over the network.

### Start the Flight server

::: {.callout-note}
Start the Flight server with your built pipeline. Replace `<BUILD_HASH>` with your build hash:
:::
```bash
xorq serve-flight-udxf --port 8001 builds/<BUILD_HASH>
```

Your pipeline is now running as an endpoint on `localhost:8001`. Keep this terminal window open while you query the pipeline.

With the server running, the next step is to query your pipeline.

## Query your served pipeline

With the server running, you can query your pipeline from Python. Create a new Python file called `query.py` in your working directory. Paste the code below into the file:
```python
# query.py
import xorq.api as xo

client = xo.flight.client.FlightClient(port=8001) # <1>

data_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/letsql-pins/penguins/20250703T145709Z-c3cde/penguins.parquet"

expr = (
    xo.deferred_read_parquet(
        con=xo.duckdb.connect(),
        path=data_url,
        table_name="penguins",
    )
    .select("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "species") # <2>
    .drop_null()
    .limit(5)
)

fut, rbr = client.do_exchange("default", expr) # <3>
result_df = rbr.read_pandas() # <4>
print(result_df)
```
1. Connects to the Flight server on port 8001.
2. Selects only the columns needed for prediction.
3. Executes the expression via Flight's do_exchange protocol.
4. Converts the result to a pandas DataFrame.

### Run the query script

Run the script:
```bash
python query.py
```

With querying complete, the next step is to learn about deploying specific expressions.

## Deploy a specific expression

For deployments, you can serve a specific built expression as an endpoint using `serve-unbound`. This allows you to expose a particular expression as a Catalog service.

### Start the deployment server

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
xorq serve-unbound builds/<BUILD_HASH> --host localhost --port 8001 --to_unbind_hash da8ba93cc97709f4ad9502e16d71e8e3
```

::: {.callout-important}
The hash `da8ba93cc97709f4ad9502e16d71e8e3` is specific to this quickstart template. When you build your own pipelines, you generate different hashes. For this tutorial, use the exact hash shown above.
:::

### View your results

You can now run your `query.py` script while this terminal is running. You see a DataFrame with penguin measurements and species predictions.

![](../../images/quickstart/quickstart-server-running.png)

The output shows the original penguin measurements alongside their predicted species classifications.

## What you built

You just built your first Xorq ML pipeline. You initialized a project, built it into a portable format, ran it to generate predictions, and served it as an API endpoint.

The entire workflow used Xorq's deferred execution model. No computation happened until you explicitly ran or queried the pipeline.
