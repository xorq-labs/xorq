After completing this guide, you have a working ML pipeline. This pipeline loads data, trains a model, and generates predictions. It uses Xorq's deferred execution model.

## What you'll build

In this quickstart, you:

1. Set up your environment and install Xorq
2. Initialize a project
3. Build a pipeline expression
4. Run your pipeline and save results
5. Serve a UDXF expression as an endpoint

The entire process takes about five minutes. By the end, you understand how Xorq transforms Python code into executable, servable pipelines.

## Step 1: Set up your environment and install Xorq

This step covers environment setup, Xorq installation, and verification.

### Check your Python version

::: {.callout-tip}
### Python version
Xorq requires Python 3.10 or higher, but also no higher than 3.13. Check your version with `python --version`. If you need to install or update Python, then visit the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
:::

### Create a virtual environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS/Linux
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

:::

### Update pip

Before installing Xorq, update pip to the latest version. This avoids compatibility issues:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install Xorq

Now install Xorq using your preferred package manager:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### pip (macOS/Linux/Windows)
```bash
pip install "xorq[examples]"
```

### nix
```bash
nix run github:xorq-labs/xorq
```

:::

### Verify installation

Verify your installation by checking the version. Open a Python shell:
```bash
python
```

::: {.callout-note}
If `python` does not work, then try `python3` instead.
:::

Import Xorq and check the version:
```python
import xorq
xorq.__version__
```

You see a version number like `'0.3.4'`.

Exit the Python shell:
```python
exit()
```

If you see a version number, then Xorq is installed correctly.

With Xorq installed, the next step is to create your first project.

## Step 2: Initialize a project

Create a new Xorq project using the built-in penguins template. This template demonstrates a complete ML workflow with the Palmer Penguins dataset:
```bash
xorq init -t penguins -p penguins_example # <1>
cd penguins_example # <2>
```
1. Creates a new project called penguins_example using the penguins template.
2. Moves into the project directory.

The template generates an `expr.py` file. This file contains a complete ML pipeline with data loading, train/test splitting, model training, and prediction.


With your project initialized, the next step is to build it into an executable format.

## Step 3: Build your expression

Convert your pipeline into a serialized, executable format using the `build` command:
```bash
xorq build expr.py
```

This serializes your pipeline and generates a content-addressed build directory.

**Output:**
```
Building expr from expr.py
Written 'expr' to builds/12287e173c17
builds/12287e173c17
```

The build creates a directory (like `builds/12287e173c17`) containing your serialized pipeline. This hash uniquely identifies your build.

![](../images/quickstart/build-output-hash.png)

Save this hash as an environment variable:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS/Linux
```bash
export BUILD_HASH=12287e173c17
```

Replace `12287e173c17` with your actual hash.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
$env:BUILD_HASH="12287e173c17"
```

Replace `12287e173c17` with your actual hash.

### Windows (CMD)
```cmd
set BUILD_HASH=12287e173c17
```

Replace `12287e173c17` with your actual hash.

:::

::: {.callout-important}
### Replace with your hash
The hash `12287e173c17` is an example. Copy the actual hash from your build output.
:::

## Step 4: Run your pipeline

Execute your built pipeline and view the results. Replace `<BUILD_HASH>` with the hash from your build output in step 3:

::: {.callout-warning}
### Windows users
Skip the first tab and go straight to "Save to file." Running without an output file might cause issues on Windows.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### View results (macOS/Linux)
```bash
xorq run builds/$BUILD_HASH
```

Runs the pipeline and displays results in your terminal.

### Save to file (macOS/Linux)
```bash
xorq run builds/$BUILD_HASH -o predictions.parquet
```

Runs the pipeline and saves results to `predictions.parquet`.

### Save to file (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
xorq run builds/$env:BUILD_HASH -o predictions.parquet
```

Runs the pipeline and saves results to `predictions.parquet`.

### Save to file (Windows CMD)
```cmd
xorq run builds/%BUILD_HASH% -o predictions.parquet
```

Runs the pipeline and saves results to `predictions.parquet`.

:::

The command saves prediction results to `predictions.parquet`. You can open this file with pandas, DuckDB, or Polars.

## Step 5: Deploy your pipeline as an API endpoint

Deploy the pipeline you built in step 3 as a live API endpoint.

::: {.callout-important}
### Using your build hash
This step uses the same `BUILD_HASH` from step 3. You're deploying the exact pipeline you just built and ran.
:::

### Start the server

Run the server with your build hash:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS/Linux
```bash
xorq serve-unbound builds/$BUILD_HASH \
  --host localhost \
  --port 8001 \
  --to_unbind_hash da8ba93cc97709f4ad9502e16d71e8e3
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
xorq serve-unbound builds/$env:BUILD_HASH `
  --host localhost `
  --port 8001 `
  --to_unbind_hash da8ba93cc97709f4ad9502e16d71e8e3
```

### Windows (CMD)
```cmd
xorq serve-unbound builds/%BUILD_HASH% --host localhost --port 8001 --to_unbind_hash da8ba93cc97709f4ad9502e16d71e8e3
```

:::

The command saves prediction results to `predictions.parquet`. You can open this file with any Parquet-compatible tool. Compatible tools include pandas, DuckDB, or Polars.

With your pipeline running locally, the next step is to serve a UDXF expression as an endpoint.


## Step 5: Serve a UDXF expression

::: {.callout-note}
### New terminal setup
Open a new terminal window. Activate the same virtual environment (`.venv`) and navigate to the same directory (`penguins_example`) where your server is running.
:::

Create a file called `query_endpoint.py`:

```python
# udxf_example.py
import pandas as pd
import xorq.api as xo

# <1>
def add_computed_column(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Add a computed column that doubles the input value."""
    result = df.copy()
    result["doubled"] = result["value"] * 2
    return result

# <2>
input_schema = xo.schema({"value": "int64"})
output_schema = xo.schema({"value": "int64", "doubled": "int64"})

# <3>
con = xo.connect()
input_table = xo.memtable({"value": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}, schema=input_schema)

# <4>
expr = xo.expr.relations.flight_udxf(
    input_table,
    process_df=add_computed_column,
    maybe_schema_in=input_schema,
    maybe_schema_out=output_schema,
    con=con,
    make_udxf_kwargs={
        "name": "double_value",
        "command": "double_value"
    }
)
```
1. Defines a transformation function that doubles input values.
2. Specifies input and output schemas for type safety.
3. Creates a simple input table with test data.
4. Creates the UDXF expression with the transformation function.

### Build the UDXF expression

Build the expression:

```bash
xorq build udxf_example.py --expr-name expr
```

This creates a second `<HASH>` in your `builds/<HASH>/` directory with your serialized UDXF expression. 

![](../images/quickstart/second-hash.png)

### Start the Flight server

Start the Flight server with your built UDXF expression. Replace `<BUILD_HASH>` with the second hash from your build output:

```bash
xorq serve-flight-udxf --port 8001 builds/<BUILD_HASH>
```

Your UDXF is now running as an endpoint on `localhost:8001`. Keep this terminal window open while you query it.

### Query your served UDXF

With the server running, create a new Python file called `query_udxf.py`:

```python
# query_udxf.py
import xorq.api as xo
import random as rnd

# <1>
con = xo.flight.connect(port=8001)

# <2>
exchange = con.get_exchange("default")

# <3>
expr = xo.memtable({ "value" : rnd.choices(tuple(range(100)), k=10) }, schema= xo.schema({"value": "int64"})).pipe(exchange)

# <4>
print("Executing via Flight do_exchange...")
result_df = expr.execute()

print(result_df)
```
1. Connect to the Flight server running on port 8001. This establishes a connection to communicate with your deployed server.
2. Get the exchange named "default" from the connection. This exchange represents the UDXF transformation you deployed.
3. Create an in-memory table with random integer values and pipe it through the exchange. This builds an expression that will apply your UDXF transformation to the input data.
4. Execute the expression via Flight `do_exchange` and print the results. The server applies the transformation (doubling the values) and returns the result as a pandas DataFrame.

### Run the query script

Run your query script:

```bash
python query_udxf.py
```

**Output:**
```
Executing via Flight do_exchange...
  predicted
0    Adelie
1    Adelie
2    Adelie
3    Adelie
4    Adelie
```

Your pipeline now runs as a live API. You sent penguin measurements to the server, the server executed your trained model, and you received species predictions back—all via Flight protocol.

## What you built

You just built your first Xorq ML pipeline. You initialized a project, built it into a portable format, ran it to generate predictions, and served it as an API endpoint.

The entire workflow uses Xorq's deferred execution model. No computation runs until you explicitly execute or query the pipeline.
