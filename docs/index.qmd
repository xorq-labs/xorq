xorq is a deferred computational framework for building, running, and serving
pandas groupby-apply style pipelines common in ML workflows. xorq is built on
top of [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) and
[Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/).

## Why xorq?

xorq was developed to give Python developers a more ergonomic way to build,
cache, and serve pipelinesâ€”without getting locked into a single engine. The
xorq computational framework provides a quantum leap in ML development by:

- **Simplifying development** - no more juggling separate SQL jobs, pandas
  scripts, and ML framework specific transformations.
- **Accelerating iteration** - intelligent caching means no more having to wait
  for full pipeline re-runs after every little change.
- **Making deployment seamless** - moving a working pipeline from local dev to
  production no longer requires rewriting.
