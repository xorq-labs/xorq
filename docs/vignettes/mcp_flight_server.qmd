description: "A demonstration of integrating machine learning models with Claude using the Model Control Protocol (MCP) server"
---

## Overview

In this example, we'll create:

- A Claude integration  with MCP server that can access the sentiment analysis
  capabilities
- A sentiment analysis model server using Arrow Flight using UDFs with xorq
- a XGBoost UDF with pre-trained model that will be served by Flight

This pattern enables AI assistants like Claude to access specialized machine
learning models while maintaining a conversational interface, expanding
Claude's capabilities beyond its training data.

## Demo
Watch this demonstration of the MCP server with Claude in action:

## Try it yourself

The complete source code for this example is available in the xorq GitHub repository:
[mcp_flight_server.py](https://github.com/xorq-labs/xorq/blob/main/examples/mcp_flight_server.py)

## How it works

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Claude
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant FS as Flight Service
    
    U->>C: "How positive is this headline?"
    C->>MCP: Request sentiment analysis
    Note right of MCP: Input mapping
    MCP->>FS: Transform text and predict
    FS-->>MCP: Return sentiment score
    Note right of MCP: Output mapping
    MCP-->>C: Return formatted results
    C-->>U: "The headline has a sentiment score of 1 (positive)"
```

Components:

- **MCP Server**: The example initializes a specialized Flight server with
  a Model Control Protocol (MCP) server. This provides a standardized way
  for Claude to interact with the ML model.

- **Flight Service**: The server loads two pre-trained models:
  - A TF-IDF vectorizer to transform text data
  - An XGBoost regression model trained to predict sentiment scores

- **Input/Output Mappers**: Custom functions translate between Claude's natural
  language requests and the ML model's required format, then transform the
  model outputs back into a Claude-friendly response.

## Next steps

Try modifying this example to create a more complex input mapping to handle various types of user queries.
